        <p>I think the purpose of this video is to make his point known. He wanted to express his feelings further than what he could do personally so he decided to take his feelings to the internet and share with the world what he felt. This video was posted to YouTube which is the worlds leading video sharing website in the world, if you want a message to get public one if not the best way to do that is to post it to YouTube and just wait. He got his message to the people of this world who will care about what he has to stay and those people will pas it along to more people and so on and so forth. The creator of this video took a very personal approach to the video, he not only appeared in the video himself, but he expressed some very persona information with the world that he wanted everyone to see and to learn from. This video helped me compose my lived project by showing me that if this man can express himself and all this information to the entire world than the least I could do is to share what I have experienced throughout my college career with a class of about thirty people.</p>

        <p>The role of women in the tech industry is and (I think) always will be lower than the men’s role. “The Social Network” shows this off by showing that Mark Zuckerburg was to good for his girlfriend and didn’t want her to slow him down. It also shows that girls are below the intelligence level of men when it comes to technology. They show off men dealing with the tech problems and business problems and the girls just being there as “girls.” The only main roles played by women in this movie are girlfriends of the main characters or some girl that slept with Sean Parker. To me this movie also shows that it doesn’t really matter if you have a fancy degree from a fancy school, either way you can be successful. Mark goes to a fancy school and he is very successful, but at the same time Mark looks up to Sean Parker, another successful man, who didn’t even go to college at all. The movie does seem to lean more towards the education side of things but it definitely hints at both paths.</p>
        <h1>Blog 3</h1>
        <p>This advertisement uses the imagery of Detroit, by showing its viewers a very industry based city and that the city can be luxurious. They do not want the audience to forget that their product, in the case cars, is still made in America and is still rigid and a strong performer. At the end of the ad they use the tagline “Imported from Detroit” this reinforces the industry feeling that we already had from the city views of Detroit. It tells us that these cars were made in Detroit and they are coming from a place a lot of people watching these commercials can relate to and some of them can even call it home. Eminem’s song “Lose Yourself” throughout the ad makes us feel more loyalty to the city of Detroit. Eminem was born and raised in Detroit and everyone relates Eminem to Detroit. </p>
