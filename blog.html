        <h1>Blog 1</h1>
        <p>I think the purpose of this video is to make his point known. He wanted to express his feelings further than what he could do personally so he decided to take his feelings to the internet and share with the world what he felt. This video was posted to YouTube which is the worlds leading video sharing website in the world, if you want a message to get public one if not the best way to do that is to post it to YouTube and just wait. He got his message to the people of this world who will care about what he has to stay and those people will pas it along to more people and so on and so forth. The creator of this video took a very personal approach to the video, he not only appeared in the video himself, but he expressed some very persona information with the world that he wanted everyone to see and to learn from. This video helped me compose my lived project by showing me that if this man can express himself and all this information to the entire world than the least I could do is to share what I have experienced throughout my college career with a class of about thirty people.</p>
