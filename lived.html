		<h1>Headsets</h1>
		<p>It didn’t take long for me to decide what I wanted to do after I graduated from Michigan State University. I had always wanted to do something that dealt with computers but never really knew what. Going into my freshmen year I declared my major as Media Information, with a concentration in video game and web design. I wanted to pursue a career in 3D modeling and animation. Once on campus I took the basic media classes and knew I was in the right place. I was enjoying my classes and was happy with my choice. So many people around me were still “undecided” or had decided and than changed their minds once, twice, some times three or more times before they found their place. I can remember feeling so relieved that I found my “home,” so to speak, so early and could dive right into my major specific classes and start enjoying my classes a little more than having to take every university required class back to back. After freshman year I couldn’t have been surer of my choice to major in Media Information. Sophomore year came and it was time to take a course in the specific thing that I wanted to do, 3D Modeling and Animation. I had never been more excited to take a class than now. After a week or so in the class I realized that maybe this 3D modeling stuff wasn’t for me. Not only was it so much more than what I had thought when making my decision, but also the type of people this career seemed to attract weren’t my type of people. After that semester I found myself right back at the beginning, looking for something that I not only enjoyed but something that was more geared towards my type of personality. At the end of the semester I was offered a job at Big Ten Network Student U. I accepted the job and started working at the start of spring semester. I really enjoyed working at Big Ten and decided to give Sports Broadcasting a shot. I enrolled in some directing and producing classes and ended up finding my new concentration, TV, Cinema, and Radio. Having a concentration in TV, Cinema and Radio opens the door to a lot of different paths; I wanted to pursue Sports Broadcasting. When I say that I am studying to pursue a career in Sports Broadcasting most people immediately think that I want to be a reporter or a sports anchor for news, but no one ever thinks about how those people are actually on your television, the behind the camera work. Before I was introduced to the world of sports broadcasting I had no idea how much work there was in order to give the viewers what they want. Sports Broadcasting includes all of the directors, producers, audio technicians, camera operators, replay engineers, etc. As a “newbie” on the Big Ten team I was first used as a utility so I could get used to how things worked and see what I was interested in and what I really wanted to do within our world. The first opportunity I had to try something other than utility was camera operator during a wrestling match. I enjoyed this and continued to be a camera operator for about 6 months until I was asked to take over our replay position from a senior who would be graduating that year. I jumped at the opening immediately and started to learn all about replays and how they get from happening live to appearing on the viewers screen over and over. I really enjoyed being at “The Table” as we call it because while we are working we are all talking with each other and letting each other know what is going on from each of our positions. This atmosphere let me thrive because of my open personality and ability to get along with almost anyone. At the start of my junior year I was head replay engineer and next in line for producing and directing. I ran replay all of my junior year and also taught some other younger students how to run replay so they would be able to take my job when I graduated or got another position. At the start of my senior year I was given the opportunity to become the assistant producer and eventually be the 2nd producer for our team. I took the job and now I am producer for Field Hockey and will be producing other sports as the year goes on.
	Looking back on my journey to where I am now there is one piece of technology that I would consider helped me discover the path I am taking. Headsets play a huge role in the sports broadcasting world. Without headsets our team would not be able to talk to each other. The director wouldn’t be able to let the cameras know what they need to shoot, the producers wouldn’t be able to relay information about the game and stats from the game to the announcers and our team would flat out not be able to function. I feel like the role that headsets play in our workplace is the same reason that I enjoy my area of study so much, they allow our team to communicate to each other, which is the original reason I decided to give sports broadcasting a shot. Headsets create the atmosphere that I was looking for in the workplace. Headsets not only play a role in my major and career, they also play a role in what I consider my entertainment. I use video games as my form of entertainment and headsets allow me to talk with the people I play with no matter where they are in the world. My brothers also play video games and with us being so far apart from each other video games is something we use in order to stay in touch and without headsets that wouldn’t be possible. 
I can remember sitting in my room trying to work on a 3D model and having no one to talk to and feeling isolated from everyone. The first day of work with Big Ten I was able to put a headset on for a little and talk with our team and interact with them, which for the first time in my life made me feel like I found something I could do for the rest of my life. I just feel that no matter what the situation is if I can be in contact with people and talk with people I feel at home and I feel like I can be apart of that community. Headsets are the portal to communication for me and without them I don’t think I would be where I am now.</p>
