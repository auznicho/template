			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>The issue that is caused by Miley’s new approach to her career cannot be solved overnight. In order to cure the problem of our youth being corrupted by what they see on TV and hear in their music would take years to solve. If we plan to make an attempt at solving this issue I think the first thing we need to do is educate our youth better. If we could get the right message drilled into out youth before they were exposed to all of the TV and music that would do the opposite; I feel that would be a great first step. Education can’t be the only thing we do in order to actually solve our problem at hand. Not only do we need to educate our youth better but we need to make sure that these people we consider “stars” are educated as well and understand how influential they are to their fans and understand that they can change peoples lives with what they sing and how they act. The only way to even attempt to solve this is to educate both sides as much as we can and hope that people can make better choices, but even that won’t help if people ignore what we know as “right”. Education won’t mean anything if we can’t make people make better choices. As I see it this problem has been going on for so long that it is basically unsolvable but just needs to be toned down. Which is what we need to aim for before we can even think about solving this issue. Without little improvements along the way this problem will continue to erode our youth and eventually it will get to the point of no return. If it ever does reach this point than it will actually be an unsolvable problem that we will just have to tolerate and try to tone down as much as we can.</p>
