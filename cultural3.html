			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>When taking a closer look into why Miley Cyrus is a great example of this I came across some of her recent music videos. Though most of her new videos show why she should no longer be considered a role model, one of these videos in particular stood out to me. Miley’s music video for her new song Wrecking Ball puts her new persona on display perfectly. During the video Miley is swinging naked on a wrecking ball, licking a sledgehammer, and dancing provocatively in her underwear. This behavior is unacceptable for someone like Miley who at one point was a role model for children, she needs to realize who she is attracting as a star and if she wants to act like she does currently than I feel she has the responsibility to let her now old fan base know that she is not the person she used to be. For Miley to just all of the sudden go from being Hannah Montana to what she is now, id unfair to her fan base who now look up to her and think that what she does is the right thing for them as well. The only thing that this video, and all her other videos, accomplishes is her showing the youth of our nation that its okay to do drugs, have sex, and act like she does. Miley made an attempt to let her fans know that the Hannah Montana days are over by releasing a statement on NBC’s Saturday Night Live that the once Disney star was murdered. This statement was needed, but maybe not in the way that Miley found appropriate. Yes, it is a good thing that she finally decided to make public that her days as Hannah Montana are over and that she is moving on with her career, but murder may have not been the best option for her.</p>
