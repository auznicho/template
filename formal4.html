    			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
        			<p>In conclusion, sports broadcasting doesn’t necessarily use the common practices of writing and research you see everywhere, but that doesn’t mean that they aren’t used. Both writing and research skills are very important to becoming a successful sports broadcaster. We have also come to the conclusion that yes, school is absolutely important but getting professional experience as soon as possible is crucial to landing a respectable job out of college and without a good reputation it will be very hard to do just that. Also resumes are always a great thing to have but a resume will never be able to rule over a recommendation from a trusted source.</p>
