        			<p>Being a student studying to enter the realm of sports broadcasting, I will need to understand certain types of writing just as any other major/career would. Most people would know what type of writing is required for sports broadcasting because all they can think of is ESPN, Fox Sports, etc., but in order for these networks to remain at the top it requires a lot of work. To start off I will talk about some very entry level writing skills that one would need to have in order to begin their interest in sports broadcasting. First things first are always basic writing skills so you can sound like a professional and help the real professionals look at you as one of them and not as a student anymore. Networking plays a huge role in the world of sports broadcasting. In our world it’s not all about what you can put on a piece of paper, though having a good resume is extremely helpful, if you know someone who knows someone and you can get a good reputation out there that will help you much more than anything you can put on paper. The way you network is by giving your contact information to anyone and everyone that you work with. This type of networking means one thing; lots of emails, phone calls, and texts that you will need to respond to and answer like a professional. First impressions are everything and you don’t make a good impression they will just flip to next business card in the pile. This type of writing skill is not very specific to any single career path and is just a great skill to have no matter what you are interested in.</p>
	<p>Now let’s get into some writing skills that are more geared towards our world of sports broadcasting. In order to have a good broadcast all parts of your crew need to be on the same page at all times during the production. For this to happen the producer needs to create what is called a Rundown for the event. A rundown is basically an information sheet that give everyone storylines for the game, players to watch for during the game, and also gives details on how each team is doing so far that season and even gives some fun facts that the announcers can talk about if they have some down time. In order to complete one of these rundowns the producer will need to do some research not only on the visiting team but also on the home team because nobody knows everything about any one team. I will talk about the research required later in the paper. There is really no specific format for the rundowns but usually they are created in excel, or a similar program, and they will have the call time which is the time the crew arrives, game time, break time, etc. A typical rundown consists of different headings such as, what type of open the crew will do, live open or pre-recorded open; this also depends on the type of event as some events will only be able to do a live open and also visa versa. The rundown will also include facts about each team and their respective records so far and the all time series record for the two teams. Each team’s head coach will have a headline with fun facts, overall record with team, and how long they have been with his/her current team. One of the most important headlines of the rundown is main storylines, this allows the announcers to talk about what is going on at the time of the event and keep the viewers entertained, it also helps the director plan some camera shots for the game to highlight certain players, coaches, or teams during the game. The rundown also includes some promotions (promos) that can be used before a break or right after a break before the action starts up again. Promos are very important because they showcase your network and inform people on where they can find your network outside of just watching it on TV, for example the network may have a website that they live stream games on or possibly a mobile app that you can download on your apple or android device. Writing these clear and precise is very important because if there are any mix-ups during the show it can be catastrophic for the broadcast and the network may lose viewers to the next network who is not making dumb mistakes due to miscommunication.</p>
	<p>Where does all this information come from you ask? Well the producer needs to do research before each game in order to gather information and choose which information is interesting enough to make it into the production. This research can be any where from looking online for stats to going to a practice and talking with the coaches and players. I think researching for the broadcast is one of the best parts of being a producer in our world. The producer is responsible for all the information that will be displayed for the viewers, so he/she needs to make sure that it is enough to fill the allotted time as well as being interesting enough to keep the viewers coming back. Also producers have to be talented at a variety of different types of research, they cant just sit down with a book or in front of a screen and get all the information they will need. Anyone at home can do that type of research by him or herself and don’t want to hear the same old stuff over and over. In order to catch the audience’s attention you need to dig deeper than just the typical headlines, this is where the research comes in. The producer will go to practices and talk to the coaches to find out team mottos, inside information that is not readily available to the general public. This type of research requires a certain type of researching skill. The producer will need to be able to conduct an interview with the coaches and players in such a way to get the information he is looking for out of them. He/she will have to ask the right questions and steer the player/coach in the way he/she wants for them to give interesting quotes and information that the producer can than use in his rundown for the event. Interviews are not the only way of getting information though; producers still need to get the hard facts that are available online. They will need to sift through the teams webpages to find what they need and make sure they have a good balance of stats and information that the audience expects and some information that will surprise the viewers and keep them tuned in to your network instead of the other guys. Some information like I just said is expected from the viewers and without it you will never be able to be a successful network. Everyone who has ever watched a sporting event can tell you what kind of stats will be shown during the game. It’s the producer’s job to make sure this information is there, or the network will lose followers. This type of research is a lot more comparable to the research you will most likely do throughout your schooling career; so this research should come a little bit easier but is still a very important skill that you will get better at the more times you do it. Sports broadcasting utilizes a very wide range of types of research, and is a great field of study to really hone in on your researching skills and try to improve them to make you a better producer, director, or even camera operator. Research plays a huge role in sports broadcasting and is an extremely valuable skill to master.</p>
	<p>When talking with Mr. Rick Church, the Director of Broadcast Technology at Michigan State University, he could not agree with me more about the importance of being proficient at both writing and research. “Both of these skills play a big role in the sports world and without them it would be very hard to find a job in this world” (Church). Mr. Church also seemed to be very straightforward with the fact that networking is much more powerful than paper in the professional world. “I would much rather hire someone that I heard about from a friend, than some one that I read about” (Church). He says that if he can get a good word from someone about a possible hire that recommendation will go 10 times further than a piece of paper written by the possible hire to purposely make him or herself look the best possible. “Reputation is everything in this world, if you obtain a bad reputation you might as well move because reputations spread like wild fires, especially bad ones” (Church). Church also states that the skills you learn from school can be very useful to you, but in order to really get a hang of things and be proficient at all the different skills you will need to have some professional experience in the “real world”. He says that professional experience is in valuable to a young adult trying to get his or her feet wet in the industry.</p>
	<p>I also spoke with Mrs. Lisa Whiting-Dobson, a professor in the College of Communication, Arts, and Sciences. She does not work directly with the sports end of broadcasting, but is extremely knowledgeable about anything and everything to do with broadcasting in general. Just as Church, Whiting-Dobson agrees that reputation rules over resume in any of the broadcasting disciplines. She stated, “It is completely different to hear from someone you trust that someone is good at what they do than to have that person write down why they think they are good at what they do” (Whiting-Dobson). She also said that each discipline of broadcasting whether it is sports, news, or theatrical has some type of writing and research that can go along with it. She gave a few examples such as: play writing and news story researching as two that stand out to her.</p>
