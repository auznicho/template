			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In this paper I will discuss the effect that Miley Cyrus’ new music video “Wrecking Ball” has on America’s youth. Miley has been through a very large transformation going from being a Disney Channel star to a modern rap/pop culture star. The effect that this has on our youth can be very significant; our youth views Miley Cyrus as a star and some even as a role model. All of these views are based off of what she had accomplished as a star on the Disney channel show Hannah Montana that was catered to children. Now with her recent up and coming into the rap/pop culture world she has made a complete 180, Miley now dresses very provocatively and her music videos relate to sex, drugs, and other things that we wouldn’t want our children hearing, seeing or even doing because they view this “star” as a role model. Miley Cyrus is not the first time that we have seen this transformation gone bad happen, many of the once famous Disney stars have ended up becoming people that we would not see as good role models for our youth. As we continue to see this happen I feel that something needs to be done so that our children do not have to see their childhood heroes and role models turn into what Miley Cyrus and many others have become.</p>
