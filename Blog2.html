        <h1>Blog 2</h1>
        <p>The role of women in the tech industry is and (I think) always will be lower than the men’s role. “The Social Network” shows this off by showing that Mark Zuckerburg was to good for his girlfriend and didn’t want her to slow him down. It also shows that girls are below the intelligence level of men when it comes to technology. They show off men dealing with the tech problems and business problems and the girls just being there as “girls.” The only main roles played by women in this movie are girlfriends of the main characters or some girl that slept with Sean Parker. To me this movie also shows that it doesn’t really matter if you have a fancy degree from a fancy school, either way you can be successful. Mark goes to a fancy school and he is very successful, but at the same time Mark looks up to Sean Parker, another successful man, who didn’t even go to college at all. The movie does seem to lean more towards the education side of things but it definitely hints at both paths.</p>
