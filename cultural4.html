			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The issue that Miley’s transformation brings is apparent. She is still seen as a role model to some young girls who followed her as Hannah Montana and than as she continued her career as a country music singer. Now as she pushes her career even further her fans, which are mostly younger women, are still behind her and still see her as a role model and think that what she does and what she sings about is okay and that they can do the same thing. America already has problems with our youth being corrupted by what we now call “stars” and when someone with the background that Miley has continues to tell the youth that all of these things are okay it doesn’t help. I think it is very difficult for a young star, such as Miley in her Disney years, to understand how much they mean to their fans and how much influence they have on so many lives. This issue is two faced in my mind, one is the fact that these young stars have no idea how much they can effect people later on in life, and how much responsibility comes with being a young star, and two that once they do “go bad” the youth that were once fans do not just stop being fans, these young boys and girls continue to watch and follow the stars and want to be them and act as they are living the same life as their role model. As I feel there is other outside issues that cause the teenage drinking, sex, and drug problem that we are having, it definitely does not help when all the teenagers see on TV and hear in the music they listen to be about sex, drugs and alcohol. If the role models that these kids are looking up to would send the message that these things are bad and would act, as they should than I think we would see a decline in all of the issues we see facing our youth. </p>
