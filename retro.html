		<h1>Final Class Project</h1>
        <p>WRA is one of those classes that a lot of people dread taking. When signing up for WRA I wanted nothing to do with it and assumed I would hate the class and probably wouldn’t show up and just overall not like the class. As I scrolled through all the topics for the different WRA classes I was practically crying because not only did I have to be in a class about these topics but also I was going to have to write papers about them. I kept scrolling and one caught my eye, Writing: Science and Technology, this one sounded at least somewhat like something I could enjoy! I immediately enrolled and hoped for the best!</p>
        <p>Going into WRA 110 I didn’t have high hopes at all, I expected to be just like any other writing class, write, write, and write some more. First day of class turned out to be not so bad. Coding? Websites? Technology? I can do this stuff. Of course there will be writing, but writing about technology and my major and things I like! After the first day of class I felt much, much better about this class. Being much more interested in the technology aspect of this class I immediately went online and started the coding lessons. I enjoyed building on my basic knowledge of HTML code and was very excited to learn more about building my own website.</p>
        <p>With all of the technology mixed into this course the writing parts didn’t feel as daunting. It also helped a lot that we got to write about things we enjoyed like our major, a social issue that we got to choose. This really helped me with the writing projects and felt them feel more like some thing I wanted to write than something I had to write. About half way through the course I felt good about a class that I thought would be my least favorite course of m college career.</p>
        <p>My advice to students looking for a WRA class to take would be to look for a topic that suits your interests. Even if you are just barely interested in something, I can guarantee you would much rather write about that write about something that you have no interest in and will just forget about the next semester. Coming from a student who does not like writing very much at all, I can say that my experience in this class was one to remember. Just the fact that a class with the WRA title could keep me interested throughout the semester and actually enjoyed parts of the class is an accomplishment for me.</p>
        <p>In conclusion I would say that the writing classes here aren’t as bad as I’ve heard some people say. As long as you can find a topic that you are somewhat interested in. For me WRA really helped broaden my view of writing and made me realize that just because its titled WRA doesn’t mean you will be writing 100 pages a week about something you have no interest in. I found a class that I enjoyed and would take again if I had the chance, which is something I doubt I would say about any other writing class. </p>
