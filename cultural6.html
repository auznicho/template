			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Seeing as I don’t see this problem ever being 100% solved, I don’t expect much to change. As I don’t see a solution I don’t really see this problem getting to the point of no return either. I think this issue will continue to corrupt our youth and there is nothing that we can do about that. Stars will always act like “stars” and people will always follow them. As long as we can control this and don’t ever let it get out of hand than I think it is manageable. We can’t change modern culture and we cant stop people from wanting to a be a part of it and follow these people that are considered stars in everyone’s eyes. All we can do is educate people and hope that they realize what they see and hear is not right and they can enjoy the music/TV without trying to reproduce anything. When we really run into problems is when people take what they see and hear and think they can do the same thing as these stars that are making millions of dollars. If we can avoid the people who act on what they see and hear than we can make that first step towards a better world. As I stated above, this problem will never be 100% solved but we can tone it down by educating everyone involved.</p>
