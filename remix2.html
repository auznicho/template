<h2>MEMORANDUM</h2>

<p>TO: Christine Daniels</p>
<p>FROM: Nicholas Auz</p>

<p>RE: Remix Project</p>

<h3>Composing in Context</h3>
<p>The issue we chose helped us compose the project a little easier because it was about Michigan State University, which made it interesting for us. We got to learn more about the campus we live on and got to see how students just like us think and feel about our topic. While putting our project together I could have a very personal feeling towards it because I have my own opinions about what we are saying. We also got a better understanding for the issue at hand. We learned as we went about the different views that people have towards academics and athletics on campus. We got hear points of view that we didn’t even know people had and that was very interesting. While putting this project together was very fun and educational, we also ran into some issues while working on it. Not all of the interviews that we had planned were executed, some of the interviewees didn’t say what we had expected and what we had wanted for the story we wanted to tell. We learned to adept and work with what he have which was a great learning experience for all of us. We will not be the only ones to see the fruits of our labor though, the reason we create these projects is for pothers to enjoy and have fun while also maybe earning a little as well. The audience plays a huge role win what we have created because if they don’t like what we have to offer than it makes it less enjoyable for us to show.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>We decided to do academics vs. athletics because we, as men, all love sports and enjoy everything there is about sports. We also realize that sports are not everything in our world and that some people may not enjoy sports as much as we do and we wanted to take this question to a more personal level, Michigan State University. Throughout the project we hit some roadblocks, I think the hardest part of a project like this is getting everything organized. It was very difficult to find time where all of us could meet and talk about our project and getting even one person to the interviews was sometimes hard as well. We tried to use a systematic approach and when it worked out and the steps we planned were followed everything went great and just as we planned, but we if we missed a step or forgot a step, that when we would run into some problems and really had to work together to finish strong.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Our research for this project might have been a little different than others. We had to use mostly personal interviews for our project, which were extremely helpful to us to see the different views that people have on our issue and be able to work off of what they said. Doing book/written research didn’t really help us much because we needed to have to have people speak their feelings and tell us how they feel about the issue at hand.</p>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>Our group overall worked well together. We were able to get a hold of each other when we needed to and could be honest with each other about our individual progress in the project. If we missed and interview or an interview didn’t go as planned we all knew about it and could all think about a solution together right away. Working in a group for this project helped a lot. We were able to spread out the work and work to our talents. Each of us were good at different things and we could exploit our talents and make our project the best we were capable of doing.</p>

<h3>Project Management</h3>
<p>I think as a group we planned our work pretty well, of course there are things we could have done better, but overall I thin we did a good job with the planning phase of this project. We were all able to talk about what we wanted to see with this project and like I said above we had good communication throughout the project and everyone knew where we stood at all times. With all that being said there are some things that I also would have done a little differently if we had the chance to do this again. One, I would plan more interviews than we need so that if one or two or even all of the interviews that we want to use either don’t work out or go bad for some reason we would have backups in place already and wouldn’t have to scramble together another interview and hop that it works.</p>

<h3>Documentary Design</h3>
<p>I think the most effective aspect of our project is that fact that it is a two-sided project. We get to hear from both sides of the issue and your not left thinking, “What about the other half of the people, what do they think?” I think this aspect really pulls together the project and makes it a very strong piece overall. We made this decision and almost all of our other design decisions together where we could all talk about what we wanted to see and what we thought would look good in our project, once again we played to our strengths and let the person with the most knowledge about something work on that and execute that to the best of their ability.</p>
