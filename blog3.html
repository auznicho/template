        <h1>Blog 3</h1>
        <p>This advertisement uses the imagery of Detroit, by showing its viewers a very industry based city and that the city can be luxurious. They do not want the audience to forget that their product, in the case cars, is still made in America and is still rigid and a strong performer. At the end of the ad they use the tagline “Imported from Detroit” this reinforces the industry feeling that we already had from the city views of Detroit. It tells us that these cars were made in Detroit and they are coming from a place a lot of people watching these commercials can relate to and some of them can even call it home. Eminem’s song “Lose Yourself” throughout the ad makes us feel more loyalty to the city of Detroit. Eminem was born and raised in Detroit and everyone relates Eminem to Detroit. </p>
