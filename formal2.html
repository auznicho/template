			<h1>A Peek Behind the Screen</h1>
    			<h2>Introduction</h2>
        			<p>When people hear the term “Sports Broadcasting” they think of their favorite teams, reporters, channels, etc. All these things are the result of what sports broadcasters do every day to make the viewers happy. When I hear the term sports broadcasting I think of much more than the average person because I work/study in this field and know the work it takes to make viewers happy. In this paper I will discuss the work that goes on behind the scenes of a broadcast of live sports, and what you need to know in order to succeed in this field. I will also overview the type of writing, research, and skill you will need to understand in order to succeed. Every profession has a certain set of skills and talents that you will eventually have to master in order to be successful.</p>
